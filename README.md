1. Create a python virtual environment. On a MacOS, do `python3 -m venv venv`. Run `source venv/bin/activate` to activate it.
1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies.
1. Create a file called `.env` in the root directory and add `OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key` to it, filling in your actual Open AI API key
1. Go to `main.py`. In this file, I will walk you through the sample solution for this challenge
1. NOTE: To run your streamlit app, run the command `streamlit run main.py` in your terminal.
